CARDIAC HISTORY:
- Acute anterior STEMI (December 15, 2025)
- Successful primary PCI with single drug-eluting stent to proximal LAD
- Peak troponin I: 45.2 ng/mL
- Estimated ejection fraction post-MI: 40-45% (moderate reduction)
- Hypertension (15 years)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (8 years)
- Former smoker (quit 2020, 30 pack-year history)

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81mg daily - LIFELONG, do not stop
2. Ticagrelor (Brilinta) 90mg twice daily - Critical: take for minimum 12 months
3. Metoprolol Succinate ER 50mg daily
4. Lisinopril 10mg daily
5. Atorvastatin 80mg at bedtime
6. Metformin 1000mg twice daily
7. Nitroglycerin 0.4mg sublingual PRN chest pain

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Patient reports overall improvement in energy level. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Notes mild fatigue with moderate exertion (climbing 2 flights of stairs). No palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. Lower extremity edema resolved. Tolerating medications well. Wife reports he has been compliant with cardiac rehab sessions (attending 2x/week).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

- Heart Rate: 64 bpm, regular
- Weight: 198 lbs (down 8 lbs from admission)
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air
- Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
- Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Extremities: No peripheral edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally
- Right radial access site: Well-healed, no hematoma

RECENT LABORATORY RESULTS (01/25/2026):
- LDL Cholesterol: 68 mg/dL (Goal <70 - AT TARGET)
- HDL Cholesterol: 42 mg/dL
- Triglycerides: 156 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 7.2% (improved from 8.1%)
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (stable)
- BNP: 180 pg/mL (improved from 450 pg/mL at discharge)

ECHOCARDIOGRAM (01/20/2026):
- Left ventricular ejection fraction: 45% (improved from 40%)
- Mild hypokinesis of anterior wall (improved)
- No significant valvular abnormalities
- No pericardial effusion

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1. Coronary Artery Disease, s/p LAD DES
   - Continue dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) - CRITICAL
   - Aspirin 81mg daily indefinitely
   - Ticagrelor 90mg BID - must continue for 12 months minimum (until December 2026)
   - DO NOT STOP THESE MEDICATIONS without cardiology approval - risk of stent thrombosis

2. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with reduced EF
   - EF improving (40% → 45%), continue current medical therapy
   - Continue Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - Consider repeat echo in 3 months

3. Hypertension - At goal, continue current regimen

4. Hyperlipidemia - LDL at goal on high-intensity statin

5. Type 2 Diabetes - Improved control, continue Metformin

6. Cardiac Rehabilitation
   - Excellent progress, continue program
   - Target: Complete 36 sessions
   - May gradually increase home activity

ACTIVITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Continue cardiac rehabilitation program
- Walking encouraged: Start with 15-20 minutes daily, gradually increase
- Avoid heavy lifting (>25 lbs) for 3 months post-procedure
- Sexual activity may resume when able to climb 2 flights of stairs without symptoms
- No driving for commercial vehicles; regular driving permitted
- Air travel permitted after 2 weeks post-discharge

DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Heart-healthy diet: Low sodium (<2000mg/day), low saturated fat
- Mediterranean diet pattern encouraged

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Emily is a 5-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented to the ED with a 4-day history of fever (Tmax 103.2°F), productive cough, and decreased appetite. Mother reports Emily had rhinorrhea and mild cough starting approximately one week prior to admission. Over the past 48 hours, she developed increased work of breathing and was noted to be more lethargic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient was admitted for IV antibiotics and supportive care. Chest X-ray confirmed right lower lobe consolidation consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Blood cultures were obtained and remained negative. She was started on IV Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg/day and transitioned to oral Amoxicillin-Clavulanate on hospital day 3 when tolerating oral intake. Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula was required for the first 48 hours (max 2L/min) and weaned successfully. Fever resolved by day 2. Patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement with improved appetite and activity level.

   - Take with food to reduce stomach upset
